# planning-grid
Plan a schedule with a color-coded two dimensional grid

This was created with Meteor and Gridster.js and inspired by <a href="http://geon.github.io/estimator/">http://geon.github.io/estimator/</a>

Mainly an experimental/educational project, though I have found it pretty useful for weekly scheduling.
